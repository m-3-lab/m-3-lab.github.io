Computational Biology, Systems Biology, Genome-Scale Metabolic Modeling, Microbiome, Machine Learning.

Dr. Bernstein is an Assistant Professor in Electrical and Biomedical Engineering with a secondary 
appointment in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics. He earned his BS in Mechanical Engineering 
from the University of Vermont and PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University. Prior 
to joining UVM, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. 
His research in the field of systems biology combines bioinformatics, computational modeling, 
and machine learning to gain quantitative understanding of microbial ecosystems. His work is at 
the forefront of genome-scale metabolic modeling where he has published in leading journals and 
presented at international conferences. Applications of his work focus on understanding the role 
of microbial organisms in environmental and human health.
