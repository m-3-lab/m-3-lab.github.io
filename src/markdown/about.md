The Microbiome Metabolic Modeling (“M-cubed”) lab develops computational tools to understand metabolic processes in microbial ecosystems. Microbial organisms are ubiquitous in nature, forming complex ecosystems that influence human health and environmental processes. Our goal is to improve quantitative understanding of these microbial systems so that we can engineer their structure and function. We focus on metabolism, the chemical reactions that maintain life, and use genome-scale metabolic networks to link genomic data to predictive multi-scale computational models.
