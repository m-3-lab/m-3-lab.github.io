The Microbiome Metabolic Modeling (“M-cubed”) lab develops computational tools to better understand microbial ecosystems. Microbial organisms are ubiquitous in nature, forming complex ecosystems that influence human health and environmental processes. Our goal is to improve quantitative understanding of these microbial systems. We focus on metabolism, and genome-scale metabolic models, through which we can link genomic data to predictive multi-scale computational models of microbial physiology.
