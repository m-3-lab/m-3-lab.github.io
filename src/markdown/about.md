The Microbiome Metabolic Modeling (“M-cubed”) lab develops computational tools to better understand microbial ecosystems. Microbial organisms are ubiquitous in nature, forming complex ecosystems that influence human health and environmental processes. Our goal is to improve quantitative understanding of these microbial systems to leverage control points of environmental processes and design treatments for human diseases. We focus primarily on metabolism, and genome-scale metabolic models, through which we can link genomic data to multi-scale computational models of microbial physiology. Current research projects in the lab relate to general improvement of genome-scale metabolic model accuracy through experimental validation, and development of dynamic computational models of the infant gut microbiome.
