Frederick Senya is a fourth-year PhD student in Mathematical Sciences (Applied Mathematics) at the University of Vermont, advised by Dr. David Bernstein. He also serves as a Graduate Teaching Assistant in the Department of Mathematics. He earned his MS in Scientific Computing from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana, where he developed a strong interest in the development and application of mathematical models to real-world problems. His current research focuses on developing mathematical models of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms that integrate redox metabolism with the goal of limiting or disrupting biofilm growth. He believes the “M-cubed” lab is a great fit for any researcher interested in developing computational tools to better understand microbial ecosystems. Outside of academia, he enjoys playing soccer, video games and traveling.
