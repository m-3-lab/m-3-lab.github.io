Dr. David Bernstein is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Vermont. His initial interest in computational modeling of complex systems developed while completing a BS degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Vermont. He earned his PhD in Biomedical Engineering at Boston University, followed by Postdoctoral training at the University of California, Berkeley where he began studying metabolic processes in microbial communities. His research focuses on the use of computational models to organize scientific knowledge into predictive frameworks and he is fascinated by the genomic potential of the human microbiome. Outside of the lab he loves living in Vermont, hiking, and cross-country skiing.
