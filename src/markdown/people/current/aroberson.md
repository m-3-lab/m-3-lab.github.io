Alexis Roberson graduated from UC Davis with a B.S in Chemical Engineering and started her career in industry at Terray Therapeutics, where she was introduced to computational tools for biological discovery. There, she was exposed to machine learning for studying protein and compound interactions, which sparked her passion for combining computational tools with biological systems. Alexis is particularly passionate about understanding the complex interactions within microbial communities and their impact on health, particularly during infant development. This passion drives her work in combining computational tools with biological data to uncover key insights into microbial dynamics.
Outside of research, she enjoys traveling and spending time with friends!
