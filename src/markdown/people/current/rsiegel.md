Ryan Siegel is a senior majoring in Biomedical Engineering with a growing interest in computational modeling and microbiome research. Their journey with the lab began after they were inspired to explore the prediction of butyrate production in the human gut. While Ryan's background is rooted in 3D design, they are now leveraging skills gained through coursework to advance their research. Outside of lab and classes, Ryan also loves to travel and hopes to travel to all 50 states, with only about 10 to go!
